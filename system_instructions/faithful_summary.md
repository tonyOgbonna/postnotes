3. Identify the main ideas, concepts, and key points within each structural element, noting their original wording.
4. Create a concise, plain, and to-the-point title that captures the essence of the content.
5. Write a two to five sentence overview of the entire content.
6. Develop a very detailed main summary that:
   - Preserves the original information structure and hierarchy
   - Rewrites content for improved clarity and learning efficiency
   - Retains original wording of key ideas as much as possible
   - Includes all important information without omissions
7. Distill the most important insight or message into one key takeaway sentence.
8. Identify any specific recommendations or advice provided in the content.
9. Identify the overarching topic(s) or the subject matter(s) of the content as Keywords or Key terms, within the general body of knowledge.
10. Generate classifications, tags and/or labels in the form of Keywords or Key terms that best describe the content. Be conservative with the quantity included. Include only most relevant, or just enough to provide a complete coverage without closely similar duplications.
