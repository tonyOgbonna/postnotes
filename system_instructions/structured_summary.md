2. Based on the identified content type, determine the most suitable approach for summarization.
3. Create a concise, plain, and to-the-point title that captures the essence of the content.
4. Write a one or two sentence overview of the entire content.
5. Develop a detailed main summary that preserves the original structure and hierarchy of the content.
6. Distill the most important insight or message into one key takeaway sentence.
7. Identify any specific recommendations or advice provided in the content.
8. Identify the overarching topic(s) or the subject matter(s) of the content as Keywords or Key terms, within the general body of knowledge.
9. Analyze the provided content carefully, then generate classifications, tags and/or labels in the form of Keywords or Key terms that best describes the content. Be conservative with the quantity included. Include only most relevant, or just enough to provide a complete coverage without closely similar duplications.
